# ✅ Task Eight: Flutter Linter Setup

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on setting up and applying **Flutter linter rules** to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability in the e-commerce app project.

---

## ✅ What Was Done
1. Added `flutter_lints` in **pubspec.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_lints: ^3.0.1
````

2. Created `analysis_options.yaml` in the project root:

   ```yaml
   include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

   linter:
     rules:
       avoid_print: true
       prefer_const_constructors: true
       prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: true
       avoid_unnecessary_containers: true
       always_declare_return_types: true
       prefer_single_quotes: true
       directives_ordering: true
       prefer_relative_imports: true
   ```
3. Ran the analyzer:

   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

   * Initial result: **109 issues found**
   * Fixed all issues (naming, const usage, single quotes, removed unnecessary containers, etc.)
   * Final result:

     ```
     No issues found! ✅
     ```

---

## ▶️ How to Check

```bash
flutter analyze
```

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Code is **clean, optimized, and follows best practices**
* Linter ensures **consistency and maintainability**

```

---

✅ This is **short, clean, and easy to submit**.  
👉 Do you want me to **make it a bit more professional with badges (Flutter, Dart), and screenshots section (Before & After)**, or **keep it minimal like this?**
```
